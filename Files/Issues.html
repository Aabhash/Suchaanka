                <h4 class="h4head">AIR POLLUTION</h4>
                <p>
                    Nepal continues to rank among the worst four performers in protecting the human health and environment due to degrading air quality.
                    The latest Environment Performance Index (EPI) 2016 released this week at the World Economic Forum puts Nepal 177 among 180 countries in terms of air quality. India, China and Bangladesh are the only countries performing worse than Nepal in an effort to improve the dramatic decline in air quality—a leading cause of death worldwide—accounting for 5.5 million deaths in 2013.
                    It has ranked Nepal 149 among 180 countries, in overall performance.

            <div id="Issue2">
                <h4 class="h4head">CHILD LABOUR </h4>
                <p>Though child labor is illegal in Nepal, an estimated 1.6 million children between the ages of five and 17 years are in the work force, according to the National Child Labor Report. About three-quarters of them are under the age of 14, and most are girls. Child workers are a frequent sight on Kathmandu's streets, whether cleaning dishes in local restaurants or making a living as conductors on the city's public transport. Many are employed in the carpet, brick and garment industries, or in private homes as domestic workers. </p>

            <div id="Issue3">
                <h4 class="h4head">WATER SUPPLY </h4>
                <p>According to the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage in Nepal, even though an estimated 80% of the total population has access to drinking water, it is not safe. Those belonging to poor and excluded groups in rural areas have limited to no access. Many in remote areas have to rely on small brooks running from the mountains and spend hours traveling to get water. Still the drinking water available is not always safe as supplied water is often polluted. One of the reasons for this is due to the fact that the surface and ground water in the Kathmandu Valley is deteriorating by natural and anthropogenic contaminations. The surface water is polluted by industry and domestic waste along with discharge of untreated sewage from tightly packed residential neighborhoods.</p>
